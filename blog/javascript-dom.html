        <h2>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS -->
        <h2>Control flow in JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- Using an example process from everyday life -->
        <h2>Loops in JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- Using an example process from everyday life -->
        <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
        <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.  -->
        <blockquote>
          The API of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite
          awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to
          work with in any language. The DOM is poorly specified and
          inconsistently implemented.
