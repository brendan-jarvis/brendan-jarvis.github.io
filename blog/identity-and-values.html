          <h2>Achievements I am proud of</h2>
          <p>
            Proud graduate of University of Otago with a Bachelor of Science in
            Chemistry and Bachelor of Laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            Investor whose investment portfolio allows me to invest in the
            future I want to live in, but has also outperformed the S&P 500
            Index since inception.

          <h2>Values that are important to me</h2>
          <h3>Financial independence</h3>
          <p>
            Since I was a teenager I have valued saving and investing so that I
            am not dependent on work for income. This is not to say that I do
            not value work or creating value for others, rather I want to
            minimise a lot of negative emotions and unhealthy relationships
            people can develop around work and finance when they lack any degree
            of flexibility or independence.
          </p>
          <h3>Health and Fitness</h3>
          <p>
            We only get one body and we are not young forever! It is important
            to me to at least try and do my best during everyday exercise and be
            mindful of what I eat and drink. This does not mean training all the
            time like it is a competition, instead the focus is maintaining a
            routine I can keep doing indefinitely.
          </p>
          <h3>Curiosity</h3>
          <p>
            This can be distracting at times but I think it is important to be
            curious about how and why things happen. Sometimes it may lead to
            useful knowledge and insight, but that is just a bonus.
          </p>
          <h3>Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Learning should not end at graduation. Learning can be uncomfortable
            or painful, but gives a feeling of progress and achievement to life.
            While giving you interesting topics to share with others.
          </p>
          <h3>Bravery</h3>
          <p>
            It is easy to be afraid and pessimistic. I would rather be
            optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.
          </p>
          <h3>Freedom</h3>
          <p>
            This is the feeling of riding on a motorcycle through a Wellington
            traffic jam while it is pouring rain. It is dangerous and
            uncomfortable but you have reclaimed the freedom that is lost to
            every one who chose to sit safe and warm waiting patiently in their
            cars.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the freedom that comes with investing in a high-volatility
            asset or stock in the hopes of outperforming putting your money
            safely into the bank or only into a home.
          </p>
          <h3>Meticulous/Methodical</h3>
          <p>
            If you are going to do something make sure you do it well and are
            proud of your work, even if your efforts will not be celebrated. At
            least you will know you did things correctly to the best of your
            ability.
          </p>
          <h3>Persistent</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have decided to do something you have to keep at it. Only
            stop or make a change if there has been a change to your original
            thesis - not just because things are tough.

          <h2>Personality assessments</h2>
          <h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
          <p>
            Last tested as a <b>ENTJ</b> but probably more of an <b>INTJ</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            ENTJ indicates a person who is energized by time spent with others
            (Extraverted), who focuses on ideas and concepts rather than facts
            and details (iNtuitive), who makes decisions based on logic and
            reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather
            than spontaneous and flexible (Judging).
          </p>

          <p>
            Logical, mathematically minded, methodical and sometimes seen as a
            perfectionist. They can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if
            rules and logic says otherwise. They are not big risk takers but
            love detail.

        <h1>Core Personal Values</h1>
        <article>
          <h2>
            A situation where I made an ethical decision while working as a law
            clerk
          </h2>
          <p>
            Members of law firm were strict on time management - this went too
            far in my opinion and they refused to provide communication or
            support to clients that was not billable hours under the Legal Aid
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would talk or listen as long as the client wanted (while others
            were telling me to hang up), ensure that they understood what was
            happening, what their rights were, and what was going to happen
            next.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was shocked to find that many clients had no understanding of what
            their current legal situation was, even while imprisoned. It seemed
            as if nobody had taken the time to explain this to them. I felt this
            required their legal representation to intervene, and I felt capable
            I was able to explain things to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lawyers continued to hold the view that their time was wasted
            because they could not bill $300/$150 per hour to support these
            clients beyond ticking the boxes required to provide the required
            representation for Legal Aid. Only my parents commended my actions
            here.
          </p>
          <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
          <p>
            I have a varied skill set with a dual background in science
            (Chemistry) and the humanities (Law). This gives me at least two
            ways of thinking about the world. Law taught me to identify issues,
            research the relevant laws, and how to apply those laws to a
            situation - and identify where others have skipped this process.
            Science taught me that a failed result is still valuable data, that
            hard problems can be broken down into digestible chunks, and those
            parts can be assembled into evidence in support of your result.
            Being able to engage in this slow and analytical mode of thinking is
            very important and I hold it in high regard. We need to be mindful
            about our thinking where it tends to be faster, more emotional, and
            more intuitive - as your emotions and intuition can be wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite my academic achievements I have always struggled to maintain
            focus when either studying or working. My learning bias is towards
            more practical hands-on learning which has not always been
            compatible with my chosen academic focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I am keenly aware of how important socialising and team fit is
            to all employment, I have always struggled with cultivating and
            maintaining these relationships. My intuitive working style is doing
            the work and getting things done; and less about socialising and
            team building.
          </p>
          <h2>
            How my strengths help me in my learning journey (and create
            obstacles)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Web development involves computers, which are logical machines.
            Programming can at times be hard and documentation can be
            intimidating. Identifying the issues, taking failure as feedback,
            and being able to break hard tasks into their easier components are
            all strengths I have learned.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will however need to remain focussed on the task and avoid getting
            distracted or procrastinating on a task. Problem solving of new and
            difficult tasks requires a steady commitment and cannot really be
            solved with the adrenaline rush that comes with trying to tackle a
            task moments before a deadline.
          </p>
          <h2>A time where I struggled through a group project</h2>
          <p>
            I had a group project in Forensic Chemistry back at University,
            where we had all agreed to take on separate components of the final
            report to share the workload. With the deadline approaching I found
            that the shared document was looking very sparse.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had already got into the zone and had considered a lot of the
            material which would form part of other's work segments. So I
            decided I would write out a draft for other's segments. This way
            nobody needed to stress that parts were incomplete, as we had a
            minimum viable product of sorts. I also thought this would help get
            them started in completing their segment as they could overcome any
            'activation energy' hurdle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next morning I found that the document was looking ready to
            present and every group member had completed their segment sometime
            overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            In hindsight, this was a very passive approach to project
            management. We should have had a group chat going where I could
            still put my draft into the document instead of having it blank, but
            should have communicated with the other team members to see if they
            were having issues with their segment, needed to discuss the work,
            or when they expected to complete their work.
