          This is my new flatmate, Luna! Luna is a King Charles Cavalier. She
          likes chewing on things, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ice</li>
          <li>Kevin (her toy duck)</li>
          <li>Fingers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Welcome to the flat Luna!</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1>Look at how Luna has grown!</h1>
        <img
          src="/images/Luna-walk.jpeg"
          alt="Cute King Charles Cavalier puppy outside for a walk."
          class="thick-yellow-border"
          height="200px"
          width="200px"
        />
        <p>
          This is Luna out for her first walk after spending months inside. Much
          like her human flatmates, Luna had to ensure she had all her
          vaccinations before going outside to exercise and explore the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna found the outside world quite overwhelming. She wanted to be
          carried throughout the walk and after a short run she was carried back
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna slept soundly for hours after her first walk. Lots of new
          information for a growing puppy to process!
