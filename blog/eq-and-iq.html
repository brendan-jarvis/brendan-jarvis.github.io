        <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to monitor, control, and
          evaluate emotions. This the ability to express and control one’s own
          emotions, along with the ability to understand, interpret, and respond
          to the emotions of others. The definition of emotional intelligence
          has been refined into four proposed abilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perceiving emotions</li>

          <li>Using emotions</li>

          <li>Understanding emotions</li>

          <li>Managing emotions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          People with high emotional intelligence can recognise their own
          emotions and those of others, use emotional information to guide
          thinking and behaviour, differentiate feelings and label them
          appropriately, and adjust emotions to adapt to environments.
        </p>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a score derived from a standardised
          test designed to assess intelligence. IQ refers to the ability to
          learn, understand, and apply information to skills, logical reasoning,
          word comprehension, math skills, abstract and spatial thinking, and
          filter irrelevant information. IQ test scores are calculated by
          comparing the test taker’s score to the average scores of other people
          in the same age group. People with higher IQ can think in abstract and
          make connections by making generalisations easier.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotionally intelligent people know emotions are powerful, but also
          temporary. They know that when a charged emotional event happens the
          emotionally intelligent response is to take some time before
          responding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotionally intelligent people have better self-awareness. Allowing
          them to understand the many factors that contribute to their emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence also about being able to think about and
          empathize with how other people are feeling. Including considering how
          you would respond if you were in the same situation. This can improve
          communication and conflict resolution as emotionally intelligent
          people approach conflict resolution in a collaborative manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing emotional intelligence can reduce stress, improving
          wellbeing and happiness. Happiness an wellbeing is intertwined with
          our self-perceptions and dispositions which benefit from higher
          emotional intelligence.
