      <h1>My approach to problem-solving</h1>
      <article>
        <h2>A time when I was blocked by a simple problem</h2>
        <p>
          Dev Academy is such a fast-paced course that I keep having to review
          documentation for simple concepts like functions and objects. I was
          blocked putting together the <code><span style="color: teal">enterScores</span>()</code> function for the
          <a href="https://replit.com/@brendan-jarvis/JS-Gradebook#index.js"
            >JS-Gradebook project</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first I Googled to get an idea for how I could do this and ‘tried
          something’. This encouraged me to use the <code><span style="color: deeppink">Array</span>.<span style="color: teal">forEach</span>()</code> method, but
          now I had to get it working. I still had an error message on my screen
          (<code><span style="color: maroon">‘undefined’</span></code> – a classic of the genre), but it was not directing me
          towards a way to solve my problem this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I went back to basics and reviewed the documentation for
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects"
            >Working with Objects on MDN</a
          >. Then after having a read of that I closed my MacBook, put on my
          workout outfit, and went for a run. Thinking through how I can work
          with Objects while on the run, I thought of a solution to try when I
          got back to the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got back and tried out this new idea, it worked! The solution I
          thought of while “not working” on the task was exactly what I needed
          to solve the task.
        </p>
        <h2>Elegantly solving a problem</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript methods are perfect for solving problems in an elegant and
          readable way. The first time I had this moment was when coding
          <a href="https://replit.com/@brendan-jarvis/Super-FizzBuzz#index.js"
            >SuperFizzBuzz</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          FizzBuzz is a familiar challenge to anyone who has done a programming
          course before – as it was for me. Reconstructing a decent <code><span style="color: deeppink">fizzbuzz</span>()</code>
          function was rather straightforward. But then it was on to
          <code><span style="color: deeppink">super_fizzbuzz</span>()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting off I had to stop myself from recreating <code><span style="color: deeppink">fizzbuzz</span>()</code> again, I
          have already created a <code><span style="color: deeppink">fizzbuzz</span>()</code> function, I should use it. So now I
          have an array, that I want to iterate through, and for each element
          call a function and then return the array with the results of calling
          that function. Hmm, off to do some Googling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google presents a few solutions using Array methods: <code><span style="color: teal">Array</span>.<span style="color: deeppink">every</span>()</code>,
          <code><span style="color: teal">Array</span>.<span style="color: deeppink">forEach</span>()</code>, and <code><span style="color: teal">Array</span>.<span style="color: deeppink">map</span>()</code>. Wait, <code><span style="color: teal">Array</span>.<span style="color: deeppink">Map</span>()</code>! I just learned
          about that and what it does, that is perfect! So now all that was left
          was to work through how to use <code><span style="color: teal">Array</span>.<span style="color: deeppink">Map</span>()</code> in an arrow function and I
          had <em>one beautiful line of code</em> – marvellous!
        </p>

        <h2>
          How I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Pseudocode</b> – great for getting an overview of the steps
            needed to process a task
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trying something</b> – great for getting started and when things
            do not work on the first try it can direct me to where I need to
            direct my research.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rubber ducky method</b> – this is more of a method that I would
            use for reviewing written content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reading error messages</b> – often quite helpful although is
            rather limited to pointing out errors that are more of the syntax
            variety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Console.logging</b> – when you have tried some code (found in the
            documentation or through Google) this is excellent for going through
            it step-by-step to see what it is doing and where the breakpoints
            are.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Googling</b> – once you know what to Google and are familiar with
            the context from learning/working with JavaScript this becomes
            almost cheating.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Asking your peers for help</b> – the short-circuit method to
            problem-solving. I have asked for a lot of help while learning
            programming in the past, which has aided my learning journey with
            JavaScript and Dev Academy a lot. This is not my first choice of
            problem-solving method as I have quite a bit of respect to the
            problem-solving process as being important to my learning journey.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Asking coaches for help</b> – similar to above this is a
            short-circuit method to problem-solving.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Improving your process with reflection</b> – thinking back this
            is probably what developed my current problem-solving process as I
            can see how helpful various techniques and tools were to figuring
            out a problem.

        <h1>Rubber Ducky Debugging Explained</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Acquire or create a rubber duck (or rubber duck substitute)</li>
          <li>
            Place rubber duck on desk and inform it that you are going to go
            over some code with it
          </li>
          <li>
            Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, go into detail
            and explain your code line by line
          </li>
          <li>
            At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and
            realise that is not what you are actually doing
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Explaining a problem to someone else helps you to understand the
          problem better and find a solution to it. It encourages you to see the
          things from a new perspective and notice things that you may have been
          missing. This is similar to reading your writing out loud, which may
          help you spot typographical and grammatical errors.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may have found yourself doing rubber duck debugging before without
          even realising it or knowing what this debugging method is. You may
          have been in a situation where you encountered a problem, decided or
          been encouraged to explain the problem to a friend, and figured out
          the solution to your problem before you have finished explaining the
          problem to your friend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rubber duck debugging removes the need to disturb someone else, you
          can substitute the person for a pet or any other inanimate object.
          Take your time and go line-by-line, focusing on the meaning, intent,
          and context for each line.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rubber duck debugging is not a problem-solving method that is
          exclusive to programming. You can use this technique in solving
          problems in all other aspects of your life!
