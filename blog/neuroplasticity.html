        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <h2>
          How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
        </h2>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity opens the possibilities to reinvent
          yourself. To break away from the status quo or to overcome past
          traumatic events that evoke anxiety and stress or encourage avoidance
          behaviours that prevent us living life to the fullest.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are all very familiar with the concept that medications and
          chemicals can change the way our brain works. This may be as simple as
          having a cup of coffee every morning to promote alertness and focus.
          By modifying our thought patterns we can also make permanent,
          significant changes to our brain structure and function. Without an
          ongoing reliance on medications or chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity encourages us to make positive changes
          to our life and keep at it when this is difficult. It is easier to
          maintain a growth mindset towards challenges when we have an
          expectation that we can change and learn new skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our
          brains function at a high level.
        </p>
        <h2>How the principles of neuroplasticity may benefit students</h2>
        <p>
          Students can use a working knowledge of neuroplasticity to their
          advantage by practicing, believing in their ability to improve and
          learn, and focusing on learning new things in context (e.g., find
          relevance to problem-solving in your own life).
        </p>
        <p>
          When we learn, we form new pathways in the brain. Each new lesson has
          the potential to connect new neurons and change our brain’s default
          mode of operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In adult learners’ neuroplasticity can restore old, lost connections
          and functions that have not been used in some time, enhance memory,
          and enhance overall cognitive skills. With sustained effort and a
          healthy lifestyle, adults can promote positive change and growth in
          their brains.

        <h2>How to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
        <blockquote>Cells that fire together, wire together.</blockquote>
        <p class="quote-citation">
          <em>Hebb's Axiom</em> – first used in 1949 by Donald Hebb, a Canadian
          neuropsychologist known for his work in the field of associative
          learning.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Challenge and novelty:</b> skills should be new to you and not
            too easy to learn. Novelty and challenge are essential components
            for cognitive change.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Intention:</b> the skill you are practicing must have some
            meaning, relevance, or important to you. Changes from
            neuroplasticity are associated with the feeling of being rewarded
            while engaging in a new task.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Specific attention:</b> the skills we practice tend to improve.
            Focusing on specific tasks and engaging in deliberate practice
            increases the likelihood of change.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Repetition and intensity:</b> a single attempt is not enough, but
            neither is a prolonged session. Shorter sets of intense repetition
            are usually better at creating new connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Time:</b> Be patient with yourself! Neuroplastic changes take
            time for structural and functional change to occur. This is where
            ensuring you get plenty of sleep, have a healthy diet, and exercise
            start to make positive contributions to your neuroplastic changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Growth mindset</h1>
        <h2>What is it and why is it relevant?</h2>
        <p>
          The concepts of a growth mindset and neuroplasticity mirror each
          other. A growth mindset is a mindset that one’s innate skills,
          talents, and abilities can be developed and/or improved with
          determination. While neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to
          adapt and develop beyond the usual developmental period of childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          A person with a growth mindset believes they can get smarter, better,
          or more skilled at something through sustained effort. This view is
          supported by neuroplasticity.
