      <h1>An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
      <article>
        <h2>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS -->
        <img
          src="/images/Luna-walk.jpeg"
          alt="King Charles Cavalier Spaniel puppy outside for a walk."
        />
        <p>
          Meet Luna. Luna is a dog. Dogs have a structure and elements, like an
          HTML page. The top of the model is <code>dog</code>, an object which
          represents the whole <code>dog</code>. Beneath the
          <code>dog</code> object are nodes and each of these is another object:
          e.g. <code>ears</code> with the attributes “big, floppy, and fluffy”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like a CSS style sheet a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel like Luna
          have certain styles. Luna has a coat <code>color</code> of “Blenheim”,
          an adult <code>height</code> of 30-33 cm, and her coat is silky with
          moderate <code>length</code>. Among many more features to her
          presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna has behaviours which operate like JavaScript instructions
          providing interactivity, responses to events, and controlling how she
          interacts with people, other dogs, and so on. These built-in scripts
          include Spaniel behaviours, which can be triggered like a JavaScript
          instructions, leading Luna to start <code>hunting()</code> or
          <code>pointing()</code>: freezing on the spot, with one paw up, and
          nose toward something she wants to bring to our attention.
        </p>
        <h2>Control flow in JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- Using an example process from everyday life -->
        <p>
          Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to
          bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line,
          unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow of the
          program such as loops, conditionals, or functions. Luna may start her
          day by waking up from <code>sleep()</code> and going to the
          <code>toilet()</code>. After she has finished
          <code>eatBreakfast()</code> she may want to play <code>fetch()</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Loops in JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- Using an example process from everyday life -->
        <p>
          Luna may enter a loop at times, especially when she wants to play
          <code>fetch()</code>. Based on the condition of Luna (and her pet
          parents) wanting to play fetch <code>throwBall()</code> is called,
          until either Luna or the pet parent is tired of playing
          <code>fetch()</code>. There could be events throughout the day, and
          Luna may start <code>eat()</code>, <code>warn()</code>,
          <code>hunting()</code>, <code>pointing()</code>, or simply
          <code>sleep()</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
        <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.  -->
        <blockquote>
          The API of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite
          awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to
          work with in any language. The DOM is poorly specified and
          inconsistently implemented.
