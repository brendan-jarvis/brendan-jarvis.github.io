        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would say that reflection has helped me to know myself better,
          improved my ability to talk about what distinguishes me as an
          individual, and identified positive learning techniques to continue to
          use in my life. In terms of ego, my view of myself has improved.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Being kind to ourselves and others as we realise that programming can
          be difficult and stressful. Understanding that learning new skills is
          possible through deliberate practice, trying things, and seeking help
          from others if needed.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I have found the core learning made education a much more positive
          experience. It was surprising to me to consider how little emphasis
          was given throughout my prior educational history to “learning about
          learn”. Understanding the educational process better is beneficial to
          avoiding learning being a dreaded task of memorisation and
          examination.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Sharing somewhat personal thoughts and feelings with others through
          the blog posts. As this puts me out there to be judged on those same
          thoughts and feelings. I think my hesitation around this is an
          expectation that if I am putting something out there, then it is
          implied there is an open invite for people to judge what I produce.
          Which is magnified when the audience is anybody with an internet
          connection willing to access my GitHub Pages website.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          To set graduates up for a lifetime of growth. In the relatively short
          time a bootcamp runs you cannot cover everything, so a viable
          alternative is to teach the fundamentals and cultivate the mental
          outlook to enable self-development into a junior developer and beyond.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          It does not feel like a waste of time. Core does not take up a
          disproportionate amount of time, maybe 20% of the course. The other
          80% of the course is tech. Yet that other 80% benefits from the time
          spent developing core skills.
