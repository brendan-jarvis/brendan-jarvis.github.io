      <h1>Learning plan</h1>
      <article>
        <h2>My long term goals or intended career pathway</h2>
        <p>
          My goals are to build on my existing web development skills that I
          gained from study at University and from building a portfolio website
          for my parents' hobby farm. This was 6 years ago and I have not really
          done any web development since then. The web development skills I was
          taught were also rather introductory-level and I self-taught a lot of
          extra skills required to host and maintain a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to start to learn more advanced web development skills.
          Such that I am on track using a web development stack that is
          in-demand among employers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would enable me to market myself to prospective employers as a
          web developer, as either a employee or a contractor. I am also
          interested in pursuing cloud computing as a speciality focus. Plus
          building my skills for working on hobby projects involving
          <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> home
          automation (<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr>).
        </p>
        <h2>My strengths and limitations in learning</h2>
        <p>
          I have an education history of dealing with complex subject matters.
          This gives me the confidence to take on educational challenges that
          may otherwise be too intimidating.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I am not an ideal student as I am easily distracted. Even
          when doing the work I have a tendency to go down a "rabbit hole"
          either trying to understand something that is not in the scope of the
          current task, implementing unnecessary features/functions, or going
          completely off-task.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be a bit of a strength at times as I have a well-developed
          skillset when it comes to research, writing, and a lot of generalised
          skills and knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills I would like to develop while at Dev Academy</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to develop the ability to work in a team in a tech
          development environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          To date a lot of my educational, employment, and hobbies have all been
          solo endeavours for the most part. These did not demand a lot of
          coordination or communication with other people as part of a
          partnership, small team, or larger organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ideal web developer should be both able to work independently as
          part of a team or a project. So ideally I improve at these
          non-technical skills.
        </p>
        <h2>How I will manage my workload through Dev Academy</h2>
        <p>
          I will work around a standard working day (Mon-Fri) between 8:30 am
          and 6:30 pm.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will conduct myself in a professional manner during working hours
          and when I am interacting with Dev Academy students and staff. I will
          also be mindful of when I may be viewed as being a representative of
          Dev Academy in public online and offline.
        </p>
        <p>When tasks start to build up I will attempt to manage them by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicating with the group through Discord or Slack.</li>
          <li>Blocking out time to focus on a task.</li>
          <li>Seeking online resources to help me solve the task.</li>
          <li>
            Requesting intervention Dev Academy facilitators to help me solve
            persistent issues.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How and where I will seek help</h2>
        <p>
          I will seek help first through course resources, appliable
          documentation, and online Q&A archives (e.g. StackOverflow).
        </p>
        <p>
          I will then seek help from my homegroup and homegroup facilitators. I
          could also seek help from the Dev Academy community/cohort.
        </p>
        <h2>What I expect from Dev Academy Facilitators</h2>
        <p>I expect from the Facilitation team to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be able to provide me with a clear and concise explanation of the
            task and the steps I need to take to complete it.
          </li>
          <li>Clarify any misunderstandings.</li>
          <li>
            Guide me through the learning and problem-solving process when I am
            stuck.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scheduling information</h2>
        <p>I will be unavailable for scheduling through the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Outside of ordinary working hours of 8:30 am to 6:30 pm, Monday to
            Friday, I am unavailable.
          </li>
          <li>
            I workout at the gym Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. This may
            take up to 2 hours (travel, workout, shower). My start time for
            going to the gym is 1:30 pm till as late as 3:30 pm. However I am
            flexible with this timing and can delay this to work on a task
            through the early afternoon or postpone my workout till the evening.
          </li>
          <li>
            On Wednesday I go for a run. This takes me around an hour. As I run
            outside through a reserve this must be before 3pm, 5pm at the very
            latest, otherwise it becomes colder and darker as the sun sets.
          </li>
          <li>
            In general the weekends are not workdays and I am unavailable. If I
            am working through the weekend however, then I will again be going
            for a run, and will be unavailable for a similar block of time to
            Wednesday.
          </li>
        </ul>
