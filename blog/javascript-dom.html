        <h2>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          Meet Luna. Luna is a dog. Dogs have a structure and elements, like an
          HTML page. The top of the model is <code>dog</code>, an object which
          represents the whole <code>dog</code>. Beneath the
          <code>dog</code> object are nodes and each of these is another object:
          e.g. <code>ears</code> with the attributes “big", "floppy", and
          "fluffy”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like a CSS style sheet King Charles Cavalier Spaniels have
          certain specified styles. Luna has a coat <code>color</code> of
          “Blenheim”, an adult <code>height</code> of 30-33 cm, and her coat is
          silky with moderate <code>length</code>. Among many more features to
          her presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna has behaviours which operate like JavaScript instructions
          providing interactivity, responses to events, and controlling how she
          interacts with people, other dogs, and so on. These built-in scripts
          include Spaniel behaviours, which can be triggered like a JavaScript
          instructions, leading Luna to start <code>hunting()</code> or
          <code>pointing()</code>: freezing on the spot, with one paw up, and
          nose toward something she wants to bring to our attention.
        </p>
        <h2>Control flow in JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- Using an example process from everyday life -->
        <p>
          Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to
          bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line,
          unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow of the
          program such as loops, conditionals, or functions. Luna may start her
          day by waking up from <code>sleep()</code> and going to
          <code>eatBreakfast()</code>. After she has finished
          <code>eatBreakfast()</code> she may want to play <code>fetch()</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Loops in JavaScript</h2>
        <!-- Using an example process from everyday life -->
        <p>
          Luna may enter a loop at times, especially when she wants to play
          <code>fetch()</code>. Based on the condition of Luna (and her pet
          parents) wanting to play fetch <code>throwBall()</code> is called,
          until either Luna or the pet parent is tired of playing
          <code>fetch()</code>. There could be events throughout the day, and
          Luna may start <code>eat()</code>, <code>warn()</code>,
          <code>hunting()</code>, <code>pointing()</code>, or simply
          <code>sleep()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pet parents will have to abide by Luna until the loop has
          finished.
        </p>
        <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
        <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.  -->
        <blockquote>
          The API of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite
          awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to
          work with in any language. The DOM is poorly specified and
          inconsistently implemented.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="quote-citation">
          Excerpt from <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em> by Douglas Crockford.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (‘DOM’) is a data representation of the
          objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the
          web. The DOM is a programming interface that represents the page so
          that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page is received as HTML code sent by the web server. At the top
          of the model is the document object, which represents the whole
          document (the web page). Beneath the document object each box is
          called a node, which is another object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM is a web API designed for the web browser to build websites
          using their rendering and scripting engines. It can be accessed using
          JavaScript, but the DOM is accessible independent of any particular
          programming language. You can immediately start accessing the DOM
          either through an inline <code> &lt;script&gt; </code> element or by
          linking a script to the web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could be as simple as a mildly annoying pop-up welcoming users to
          your page:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code style="text-align: left !important"
            >&lt;<span style="color: deeppink">body</span>
            <span style="color: teal">onload</span>="<span
              style="color: magenta"
              >alert</span
            >('Welcome to my home page!');"&gt;</code
          ><br /><br /><button onclick="alert('Welcome to my home page!');">
            See what this does
          </button>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Accessing data - arrays vs objects</h2>
        <!-- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. -->
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>
          The array is a list-like object for storing data. It allows us to
          store multiple values under a single variable name. We can efficiently
          loop through an array and access each value individually, doing the
          same thing to every value. This is a more efficient storage method for
          data than the alternative of storing every value in its own variable.
          Arrays consist of square brackets and items separated by commas.
        </p>
        <p>Suppose that Luna wants to keep track of all of her toys:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            ><span style="color: deeppink">const</span>
            <span style="color: teal">toys</span> = ['Kevin the Duck', 'Ranger',
            'Yummy Rope', 'Tennis Ball', 'Orange Rubber Ball', 'Towel'];</code
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To access a value from the array we simply use the items index,
          starting from 0. So:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><span style="color: teal">toys</span>[0]</code> =
          <code>'Kevin the Duck'</code><br />
          <code><span style="color: teal">toys</span>[3]</code> =
          <code>'Tennis Ball'</code><br />
          <code><span style="color: teal">toys</span>[5]</code> =
          <code>'Towel'</code>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>
          As you may have noticed by now most things are objects, including core
          JavaScript features such as arrays and the DOM. We can create our own
          objects as a collection of related data and/or functionality.
        </p>
        <p>We could use an object to store Luna’s characteristics:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            ><span style="color: deeppink">const</span>
            <span style="color: teal">dog</span> = {<br />
            <span style="color: teal">&nbsp;&nbsp;name</span>: 'Luna', <br />
            <span style="color: teal">&nbsp;&nbsp;age</span>: '5 months', <br />
            <span style="color: teal">&nbsp;&nbsp;breed</span>: 'King Charles
            Cavalier Spaniel', <br />
            <span style="color: teal">&nbsp;&nbsp;coatColour</span>: 'Blenheim',
            <br />
            <span style="color: teal">&nbsp;&nbsp;favouriteToy</span>: 'Kevin
            the Duck' <br />
            };</code
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To access a value in this object we use dot notation, the syntax looks
          like this: <code>object.property</code>.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">dog</span>.<span style="color: deeppink"
              >name</span
            ></code
          >
          = <code>'Luna'</code><br />
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">dog</span>.<span style="color: deeppink"
              >age</span
            ></code
          >
          = <code>'5 months'</code><br />
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">dog</span>.<span style="color: deeppink"
              >breed</span
            ></code
          >
          = <code>'King Charles Cavalier Spaniel'</code><br />
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">dog</span>.<span style="color: deeppink"
              >coatColour</span
            ></code
          >
          = <code>'Blenheim'</code><br />
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">dog</span>.<span style="color: deeppink"
              >favouriteToy</span
            ></code
          >
          = <code>'Kevin the Duck'</code>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The usefulness of functions</h2>
        <!-- Explain what functions are and why they are helpful -->
        <p>
          Generally programming is about factoring a task into a set of
          functions and data structures. Functions let us store a single task in
          a block of code, which we can use with a short command – rather than
          having to re-enter the same code or manually repeat the same task
          multiple times.
        </p>

        <p>A function in JavaScript looks like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            >function <span style="color: teal">myFunction</span>() {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: deeppink">//</span> code goes
            here<br />
            }</code
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here's how we can use the function:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><span style="color: teal">myFunction</span>();</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We may want to have a function that takes a parameter:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            >function <span style="color: teal">myFunction</span>(<span
              style="color: maroon"
              >input</span
            >) {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: deeppink">alert</span>(<span
              style="color: maroon"
              >input</span
            >)<br />
            }</code
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which we will call and pass a parameter to:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">myFunction</span>(<span
              style="color: maroon"
              >'Hello World!'</span
            >);</code
          >
          <br /><br /><button onclick="alert('Hello World!');">
            See what this does
          </button>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We can also pass multiple parameters to a function:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            >function <span style="color: teal">myFunction</span>(<span
              style="color: maroon"
              >input1</span
            >, <span style="color: maroon">input2</span>) {<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: deeppink">alert</span>(<span
              style="color: maroon"
              >input1</span
            >
            + <span style="color: maroon">input2</span>)<br />
            }</code
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which we will call and pass two parameters to:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <code
            ><span style="color: teal">myFunction</span>(<span
              style="color: maroon"
              >'Hello '</span
            >, <span style="color: maroon">'World!'</span>);</code
          >
          <br /><br /><button onclick="alert('Hello World!');">
            See what this does
          </button>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Functions are useful for re-using code and for keeping our code
